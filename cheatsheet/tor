# tor
There are generally two ways through which we can proxy traffic
through tor:
1) using proxies like proxychains
2) setup the specific application through the network/proxy settings

# Start tor
sudo systemctl start tor
sudo systemctl status tor

# Check tor is working
We can check our IP address once the Tor service is up by doing:

curl http://checkip.amazonaws.com/
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 http://checkip.amazonaws.com/ 

We should see two different IP addresses, we can also use another
website:
curl ifconfig.me
curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 ifconfig.me

# Proxy traffic through tor (proxychains)
;; be sure to copy the tor proxychains config (that is the default)
;; using dynamic chain and a socks4 proxy on port 9050 (see config/proxychains_tor)
proxychains curl ifconfig.me

# Proxy traffic through tor (torsocks)
A good tool to use is torsocks which we should always prefer wrt
torify (since torify leaks DNS).
Torify will spawn a shell where all the operations will be done
through tor:

torsocks --shell 
;; or
. torsocks on

# Proxy traffic through tor for some applications (environment variables)
;; For some software we may need to set environment variables
export {http,https,ftp,all}_proxy="socks://localhost:9050"




## Change Circuit
killall -HUP tor 

## Firefox does not open .onion links
Well you should use tor-browser, but if you
really want to use firefox you should do this:

1. Launch Firefox web browser, type about:config in the address bar and press Enter.
2. After clicking on the “I’ll be careful, I promise” button, proceed to Firefox advanced settings manager.
3. In the search box type network.dns.blockDotOnion to find the setting we need.
4. Make sure the value of this setting is set to false. If the value is true, then double-click on this setting to switch it back to false.
5. That’s it. Now Firefox will be able to open all sites that operate using the .onion top level domains.

## Connecting to Freenode Via Tor
https://freenode.net/news/tor-online

The hidden service requires SASL authentication, as before. In addition,
due to the abuse that led Tor access to be disabled in the first place,
we have unfortunately had to add another couple of restrictions:

You must log in using SASL's EXTERNAL or ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE
If you haven't set up the requisite SASL authentication, we recommend
SASL EXTERNAL. You'll need to generate a client certificate:

    openssl req -x509 -sha256 -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 1000 -nodes -out freenode.pem -keyout <name_of_network>.pem

NOTE: It iss very important to remember the name of the pem file, since it should
match the one of the TORed network.

Then also save in your clipboard the fingerprint of the key, since we will need
to add this to our account.
We can do this, by issuing:
    
    openssl x509 -in freenode.pem -outform der | sha1sum -b | cut -d' ' -f1


At this point we have to login on clearnet freenode as we would normally do, with any
kind of authentication we desire.
Once we have logged in, we can add our fingerprint by doing:

    /msg NickServ CERT ADD <fingerprint>

Now we should just run tor and setup the socks5 proxy in our IRC client
listening for all connections on localhost:9050 (i.e., the default port).
As of hexchat, a good config is to:
- Server: ajnvpgl6prmkb7yktvue6im5wiedlz2w32uhcwaamdiecdrfpwwgnlqd.onion (check if it's still this)
    (we may avoid to specify the port for the server)
- Connect to selected server only 
- Use SSL for all the servers on this network
- Accept invalid SSL certificates
- Login Method: SASL EXTERNAL (cert)

NOTE: (AGAIN), remember that the pem certificate file should match the name
of the network we created.
