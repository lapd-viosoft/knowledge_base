# neo4j
# Default creds are neo4j/neo4j
# We can play with neo4j here:
# https://sandbox.neo4j.com/login
#
# Basic Analogy between SQL query and Neo4j cypher query:
# SQL syntax: Select count (EMP-ID) from Employee where COMPANY_NAME='X'
# Cypher syntax: match (n) where n.CompanyName='X' return count(n);
#
## Some administrative commands can only be executed when using
## the "system" database. To switch to the system database
## from a neo4j shell we can do ":use system;"
#
## Notice that neo4j by default limits our results both by default
## in example queries by using `LIMIT 25` but also in the settings
## where the entry `Initial Node Display` is set to a specific value.
## Also if we remove the `LIMIT 25` from queries we will still be
## limited graphically to the Initial Node Display, so we can 
## increase this value from the settings.
## Note that this limit only applies to the visualization graphs and
## not the raw table data that we can textually view or export.
#
## Note on performance:
## we can try to configure min/max heap and pagecache in the neo4j.conf.

# Run a neo4j instance from docker
docker run --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 \
