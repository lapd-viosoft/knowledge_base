# Get a list of default public networks available
/network list
/network

# Connect to a specific network
/connect Freenode
/server Freenode
/connect irc.freenode.org    ;; via specific address

# Join a channel
/join #channelname

# List public channels on a server
/list
/list *[Gg]ardening*         ;; search for all channels having gardening or Gardening in their name
It may be useful to save output to a file by doing:
/lastlog -file output.txt

# Save output of window to a file
/lastlog -file output.txt

# Switch between channels
/1   ;; switch to channel 1
/2   ;; switch to channel 2
/3   ;; switch to channel 3

# Scroll Up/Down messages
ALT-p, ALT-n       Up / Down
pageup, pagedown   Up / Down

/scrollback home: go to the first line of the buffer.
/scrollback end: go to the last line of the buffer.
/scrollback goto 13:05: scrolls back to 13:05.
/scrollback goto -100: scrolls back 100 lines.
/scrollback goto +50: scrolls forward 50 lines.

You can use /sb instead of /scrollback to save time typing.

## Search Channels (Freenode Specific)
/msg alis LIST searchterm
/msg alis LIST * -topic multiple*ordered*search*terms
/msg alis LIST * -min 50
/msg alis LIST #foo*
/msg alis LIST #foo* -mode =n
/msg alis LIST *freetopic* -mode -t -show mt
/msg alis LIST ##nocolors* -mode +c -show t

For example, for channel names, from most to least specific:
?bar       - any character followed by "bar" with no other characters
#bar*      - anything starting with "#bar"
###*bar*    - anything starting with ## and containing "bar"
#*cows*moo* - anything containing "cows", 0 or more characters, and "moo"
#*bar*      - anything containing "bar" (equivalent to "bar")

* /WINDOW <number>          - Jump to any window with specified number
* Ctrl-P, Ctrl-N            - Jump to previous / next window


## Users

# Check if user is online
/ping username

# Get information about administrators of a specific server
/stats

# Viewing channel names on new messages
/set actlist_names on

# Save configuration in configuration file
/save

# To limit channel background noise (joins, parts, quits, etc.):
/ignore #foo,#bar JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS   ;; Quieten only channels `#foo`, `#bar`
/ignore * JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS           ;; Quieten all channels

# To quit Irssi:
/exit

# Save this in config to automatically ignore joins parts and quits messages
ignores = ( {
   level = "JOINS PARTS QUITS"; 
   network = "Freenode"; 
} );
