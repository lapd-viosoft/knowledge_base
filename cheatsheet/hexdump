# hexdump
# -v, --no-squeezing:
# The -v option causes hexdump to display all input data.  Without the -v option, any number of groups of output lines which  would
# be  identical  to  the  immediately preceding group of output lines (except for the input offsets), are replaced with a line com‚Äê
# prised of a single asterisk.

# To get hex of a file
hexdump -v <file>

# To get hex + ASCII of a file
hexdump -vC <file>

# To get hex + ASCII of a file
hexdump -vC <file>

# To get hex with a specific format
The `-e` option is quite esoteric, but the general
format is:
hexdump -e ' [blocks]/[byte_count] "[format string]" '
hexdump -e ' [blocks]/[byte_count] "[format string]" "[separator]"'
for example to print 16 bytes in hex formats on every line separated by space
we can do:
hexdump -e '16/1 "%02x " "\n"'

To print 4 blocks per line (4 blocks where each block is a single byte):
hexdump -e '4/1 "%02x " "\n"'

To print 16 blocks per line where each block is 4 bytes we can do:
hexdump -e '16/4 "%02x " "\n"'

To print 6 blocks per line each with 4 bytes expressed in the form of 0xbbbbbbbb
and using a comma as a separator we can do:
hexdump -v -e '6/4 "0x%08x, "' -e '"\n"'


# From hex to binary and back
hexdump -e '16/1 "%02x " "\n"' .bash_history > myhex
xxd -r -p myhex > original_file
