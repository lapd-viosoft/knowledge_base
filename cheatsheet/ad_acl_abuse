# Active Directory ACL Abuses


## DCSync
If we have credentials of a user who have DCSync rights (this can happen
typically with backup users) we can dump all the data from a domain
controller by doing:

    secretsdump.py -dc-ip <DC_IP> THROWBACK/backup@<DC_IP>

This basically will get all the NTDS.dit database and some kerberos
stuff.
Basically we can perform DCSync is possible whenever a user or a group
has the following rights with respect to a domain controller:
- GetChanges
- GetChangesAll
