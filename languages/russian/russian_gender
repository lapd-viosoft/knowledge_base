# Russian Gender

In russian there are three genders:
- Masculine
- Feminine
- Neuter

There are simple rules which allow us to determine MOST of the genders
related to nouns that are:
- Masculine nouns almost always end with "a consonant" or "-й"
    e.g.,
    борщ          (borsch)
    Иван          (Ivan)
    чай           (tea)
- Feminine nouns almost always end with "-а" or "-я"
    e.g.,
    сметана       (sour cream)
    Наталья       (Natalia)
    Москва        (Moscow)
- Neuter nouns almost always end with "-о" or "-е"
    e.g.,
    - окно        (window)
    - вино        (wine)
    - упражнениеa (exercise)


A confusing case comes with words ending with the soft sign "ь",
since most of these names are feminine but there are many masculine
too, so we have to leaarn them one by one.

## Exceptions

Nouns ending with "а" or "я" but which refer to a masculine thing,
then are considered masculine, such as "папа" (dad) оr "дядя" (uncle).

Nouns borrowed from foreign languages ending with "и", "ю", "у" are
considered neuter, such as "такси" or "меню"
