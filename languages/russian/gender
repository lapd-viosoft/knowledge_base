# Russian Gender

In russian there are three genders:
- Masculine
- Feminine
- Neuter

There are simple rules which allow us to determine MOST of the genders
related to nouns that are:
- Masculine nouns almost always end with "a consonant" or "-й" or "-ь"
    e.g.,
    борщ          (borsch)
    Иван          (Ivan)
    чай           (tea)
- Feminine nouns almost always end with "-а" or "-я" or "-ь"
    e.g.,
    сметана       (sour cream)
    Наталья       (Natalia)
    Москва        (Moscow)
- Neuter nouns almost always end with "-о" or "-е"
    e.g.,
    - окно        (window)
    - вино        (wine)
    - упражнениеa (exercise)


Remember! The only ending shared by more than one gender is the letter "ь".
The words ending with the soft sign "ь" can be confusing, since most
of these names are feminine but there are many masculine too, so we have
to learn them one by one.


## Some common "-ь" words

When that happens, you will have to memorize each noun with its
gender. These are the most common words with the ending -ь:

Masculine
    гость (guest)
    день (day)
    дождь (rain)
    календарь (calendar)
    словарь (dictionary)

Feminine
    мать (mother)
    дочь (daughter)
    тетрадь (notebook)
    ночь (night)
    осень (autumn)




## Exceptions

Nouns ending with "а" or "я" but which refer to a masculine thing,
then are considered masculine, such as "папа" (dad) оr "дядя" (uncle).

Nouns borrowed from foreign languages ending with "и", "ю", "у" are
considered neuter, such as "такси" or "меню"
