# Russian Consonants

Russian consonants are split into two groups of 15, which are pronounced
in two different ways:
- Palatalized (aka "soft")
- Non-Palatalized (aka "hard") 

When a consonant is "soft" it means that you pronounce it with your
tongue raised high; for "non-palatalized" consonants it stays low.

We can tell the "softness" of a consonant from a vowel letter spelled
afterwards:

- А, Ы, У, Э, О    - follow "hard" consonants 
- Я, И, Ю, Е, Ё    - follow "soft" consonants

If there is nothing after a consonant, the 
soft sign Ь is used to show the softness.
