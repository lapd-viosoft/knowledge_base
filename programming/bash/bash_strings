# Bash Strings and Arrays

#Let's see how to create an array
names=("Bob" "Peter" "$USER" "Big Bad John")
for i in "${names[@]}"; do echo "$i"; done

#Now we create a normal string
example=" this is an example how do you do ?"

myarr=($example) #this creates an array from a string

echo "${myarr[@]:0:4}" #prints only from element 0 and gets 4 elements from that
echo "${myarr[@]:2:4}" #prints only from element 2 and gets 4 elements from that


echo "${#Unix[@]}" #prints the number of elements

echo "${#Unix[3]}" #prints the length of the 4th element of the array

echo "${example/d/D}" #substitutes the first occurrence of d with D

echo "${example//d/D}" #substitutes all the occurrences of d with D 

echo "${example#*d}"  #deletes from left until the first occurrence of d included
echo "${example##*d}" #deletes from left until the last occurrence of d included

echo "${example%d*}" #deletes from right until the first occurrence of d included
echo "${example%%d*}" #deletes from right until the last occurrence of d included

# example, given the string:
example="this is an example, string with racecars and dragons"
#let's see what the following commands will output

echo "${example#*c}"   #ecars and dragons
echo "${example##*c}"  #ars and dragons
echo "${example%c*}"   #this is an example, string with race
echo "${example%%c*}"  #this is an example, string with ra

echo "${example:3}"   # Remove the first three chars (leaving 4..end)
echo "${example::3}"  # Return the first three characters

#Let's see still some other example:
VAR=foofoobar
${VAR/foo/bar} # barfoobar
${VAR//foo/bar} # barbarbar
${VAR//foo} # bar

# Read elements of an IP address inside an array
IFS=. read -a ip_elements <<< "127.0.0.1"
