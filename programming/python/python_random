# python random module

# random is a standard library module, useful to:
- deal with random samples;
- picking up random elements from sequences;
- generate random numbers

# Generate a random integer number between 0 and 100 (extreme included)
random.randint(0, 100)

# Pick a random element from a sequence
seq = [1,2,3,4,5, "a", "b", "c"]
random.choice(seq)
"b"

# Pick a random element from a sequence and assign weights
seq = [1,2,3,4,5]
random.choices(seq, [0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.96])
5

# Pick k random elements from a sequence and assign weights
seq = [1,2,3,4,5]
random.choices(seq, [0.01,0.01,0.01,0.01,0.96], k=3)
5 5 5
